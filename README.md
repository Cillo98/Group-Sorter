# Group-Sorter
## _An organizer to sort entities with attributes among balanced groups_

Thig program sorts any number of entities with attributes among a set number of groups. The goal of the program is to keep the groups balanced at any point in time without knowing the total number of entities.

## Models
Each entity is defined by a set of three attributes and each attribute is a letter of the alphabet in the range _A~E_. For example, an entity could be AAA or ABD or BBE. 
Similarly, each group will have a number identifying the strength of each skill. For example, a group could have the following attributes: A 13; B 12; C 5; D 0; E 12. Balanced groups have similar values for the same attribute.
